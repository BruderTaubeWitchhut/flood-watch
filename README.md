# 🌊 FloodWatch

**FloodWatch** is an AI-powered flood prediction and early warning platform that combines **real-time weather APIs**, **simulated IoT data**, and **AI-based analytics** to forecast and visualize potential flood risks. It’s designed to empower communities, authorities, and organizations to prepare for disasters before they strike.

---

## 🌍 Inspiration
With climate change accelerating extreme weather events, floods have become more frequent and unpredictable. Many communities lack access to timely and localized warnings. FloodWatch was conceived to bridge that gap — transforming raw weather data into intelligent, actionable insights.

---

## 💡 What It Does
FloodWatch continuously monitors environmental conditions such as:
- Rainfall, humidity, temperature  
- River and reservoir levels  
- Wind and storm data  

It then processes this information through an AI prediction engine that estimates **flood likelihood** and displays real-time alerts, maps, and statistics on a clean, responsive dashboard.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Data Collection** – Pulls live weather and environmental data from APIs (OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI).  
2. **AI Analysis** – Processes multi-variable data through trained models (Random Forestand LSTM for time-series).  
3. **Visualization** – Displays risk zones, rainfall trends, and probability metrics in real-time.  
4. **Alerts** – Generates early warnings and recommendations through the web dashboard.  

Currently, FloodWatch runs as a **prototype using only APIs** for data simulation. Integration with **IoT sensors** (rainfall, soil moisture, water level) will be added in future updates for hyperlocal accuracy.
